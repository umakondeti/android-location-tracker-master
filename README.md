## Android Location Tracker
An Android location tracker forked from [jcs/triptracker](https://github.com/jcs/triptracker) and modified to use [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) as a backend. This fork also uses Google Play Services' fused location API to track the location using GPS, wifi and cell networks.

### Location Tracker
The App sends location updates at a specified time interval to a given Firebase URL. Basic Email/Password authentication is used to allow for multiple users.

**This is still work-in-progress.**
